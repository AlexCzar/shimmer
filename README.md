--Quaker--

Little Kde KWin scipt to provide generic Quake-style terminal support for any app.

Currently, the script is hard-coded for the Terminator app, but any app can be specified
in content/code/main.js.

--Issues--

* Focus issue when restoring on a desktop with no windows
* Does not follow desktop switches in correct state.
